  def should_compute_average?
    # Average of 5 and Mean of 3 rounds should definitely attempt to compute the average (the average
    # may still be empty because of combined rounds).
    # Best of 3 is weird. We actually do want to populate the average column for best of 3 with:
    #  - 333fm was changed from allowing best of 3 (and disallowing mean of 3) to allowing mean of 3 (and disallowing best of 3).
    #    See "Relevant regulations changes" below.
    #    With this change in format, the Board decided to compute means for all
    #    the old best of 3 rounds, and assign mean records to them.
    #    However, we could not change the format of the rounds, as that would have affected rankings
    #    in past competitions, so the rounds remain as best of 3, but with an average computed.
    #  - 333ft has a similar story to 333fm. It also changed from allowing best of 3
    #    (and disallowing mean of 3) to allowing mean of 3 (and disallowing best
    #    of 3). See "Relevant regulations changes" below.
    #  - 333bf is quite a special case. At competitions, competitors are ranked according to best of 3, but
    #    the WCA awards records on both single and mean of 3.
    #    See https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9b3b.
